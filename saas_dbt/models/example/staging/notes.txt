    DBT Staging Model Checklist (Goal-Aligned)

1. Define the Goal
What metrics or outputs will depend on this model? (e.g., MRR, ARR)

Who are the downstream consumers? (BI tools, data marts, other models)

What qualities are critical? (Consistency, accuracy, scalability, performance)

2. Understand the Raw Data
Review structure: column names, data types, nullability, sample values

Identify missing keys: primary/foreign keys not present but logically implied

Check encoding and formatting issues (e.g., NA strings, inconsistent casing)

3. Source Configuration
Create sources.yml with:

Proper naming of source tables

Column-level descriptions

Source-level tests if needed (freshness, loaded_at_field, etc.)

4. Model Naming and Structure
Prefix with stg_

Use consistent, snake_case naming for columns and models

Separate staging models by source table (1:1 mapping)

5. Transformation Planning
Column renaming for clarity and consistency

Data type standardization (e.g., timestamp, numeric, boolean)

Text normalization (lowercasing, trimming, formatting)

Null handling and default value logic

Enrich fields if needed (e.g., derived flags, categorization)

6. Test Planning
not_null and unique for primary keys

relationships to validate join keys across tables

accepted_values for categorical fields

Set severity: warn or error depending on tolerance and trust level

7. Materialization Decision
Default to materialized: table

Avoid incremental unless upstream data supports changelogs or row uniqueness

Avoid view if downstream dependencies are complex or latency-sensitive

8. Documentation (schema.yml)
Add table description aligned with business context

Add column-level descriptions

Reference testing decisions and known assumptions

9. Dependency Awareness
Consider upstream volatility: if the source table structure might change

Consider downstream fragility: if multiple models rely on the staging model

Build for stability and reusability

10. Version Control and Dev Hygiene
Commit schema planning before implementing model logic

Track model iterations using branches and commits

Use meaningful commit messages and isolate staging changes per PR



based on our goal (mrr, arr) for our case here, the upstream volatility im think would be low, 
i mean the size of the source data will definitely grow but the structure would remain same there 
shouldnt be any changes to that. additionally there will lots of downstream dependencies 
as mrr and arr will be used in dashboards reports as parent metric and accessed at different levels.
 how does this requirement influence design of staging model. 

 It influences the design in four direct ways:

Materialization Type
→ Use materialized: table to ensure faster performance and stability across many downstream reads. 
Avoid view as it recalculates every time. Avoid incremental unless future ingestion allows row-based 
updates or changelogs.

Rigorous Standardization
→ Ensure all renaming, casting, formatting, and null handling are deterministic and locked. 
Downstream models must not reapply these transformations. Staging becomes the single point of standard.

Test Coverage
→ Maximize integrity checks (not_null, unique, accepted_values, relationships). Downstream failures 
due to inconsistent staging will ripple across all reports and dashboards.

Backward Compatibility
→ Never change column names, types, or logic in the staging model without clear versioning or 
change management. Treat the staging layer as an interface contract for all downstream users.
